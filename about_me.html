      <h3>Bruno Citoni, an introduction</h3>
</header>

<a>I was born on a Wednesday. I like doing many different things: eletronic design, music, writing the beginning of novels, coding the beginnings of games, playing football.</a> <br> <br> <br>
    
    <a> I love first person perspective, both in video and in writing. My favourite TV show is Peep Show and my favourite book Fight Club. This is a video of me playing football with a GoPro on my head.</a>
