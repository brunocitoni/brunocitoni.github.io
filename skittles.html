      <h3>Skittles Auralisation</h3>

    <a> The resulting data is available as a spreadsheet to <a href="skittles_data.xlsx" download>download</a>.</a>
    <br> 
    <br>  
    <a>A PureData piece of software was also developed to put said data into aural form. Below is a video demostration of said software. </a>
